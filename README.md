MarkForSell
===========

WoW addon that allows you to automatically sell any unwanted items, hassle-free!

## Disclaimer

Based on Peddler.

Changed to not sell grey items by default.

## Description

*MarkForSell* simply allows you to flag items that you plan to sell, automatically selling them later when you interact with a vendor.

While going back to complete low-level quests with regards to getting a few quest achievements, I found my bags full of green quest rewards that I would try to sell whenever I could. However, after leaving a vendor I would notice that I'd missed one or two items; I made this addon so that I could immediately mark the newly received items without having to scour my bags for them later on!

## Usage

*CTRL+Right-click* on an item in your inventory and it will be flagged for peddling at your next trip to a vendor! A small set of coins appears in the item's icon to highlight that it will be automatically sold.

*/markforsell* displays the interface's options:

*Modifier Key* - allows the user to change the marking modifier from the CTRL-key.

*Sell Limit* - toggles whether or not MarkForSell should sell items in sets of 12, allowing the user to buyback any mistakenly marked items.

*Silent Mode* - toggles whether or not MarkForSell will print anything to the chat-log when selling items.
